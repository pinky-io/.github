# Pinky.io

Pinky.io is a new Peer-to-Peer NFT Lending & Renting protocol. We aim to solve major pain points from existing projects and enhance User Experience to its maximum.


This project, realized during the [ETHGlobal Lisbon Hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/lisbon) in May 2023, was among the 10 finalists of the event.
Please note that the project is still in a Proof of Concept state, and there is still **a LOT** of features to fix & implement.
